          This map illustrates the inter-provincial migration and economic disparities in China in
          2010. The choropleth map is symbolized with quantile classification 1 of Gross
          Domestic Production (GDP) per capita in each province. The color changes from light
          to dark red to symbolize the low to high values. It reveals the economic status of each
          administrative region and economic disparities across the country. The proportional
          node symbols represent the gross inflow of population in each province with quantile
          classification. It indicates the degree of attraction of each province to migrants from
          other provinces. The graduated flow symbols are symbolized with quantile
          classification of modularity of the migration flow between provinces. Modularity
          represents normalized flow by reducing the effect of population size. The graduate
          increase of thickness and blackness presents higher modularity, emphasizing the
          increment in value. The choropleth map, node symbols and flow symbols are
          classified with quantile method for comparison among the value distribution to find
          relationships. 100 top flows are shown to limit the visual clutter caused by
          overlapping flow lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flow pattern indicates three insights. Firstly, the top 100 flows indicate that the
          main inter-provincial flows happen between neighboring provinces. Only a few
          provinces, such as Shanxi, Beijing, Shanghai and Anhui (Reference in Figure Provinces of China),
          attract migrants move across another provinces. These are also some of the places that
          attract the most flows and has most inflow population. Places that send the most flows
          are Shandong and Ningxia. The relationship between inflow population and economic
          disparities varies in different geographical divisions (reference in Figure Provinces and geographical divisions of China). Positive
          relationship can be found in south, southwest and northwest China with high-high and
          low-low values in GDP per capita and gross inflow. However, the relationships
          change in north, central, east and northeast China. Provinces in low economic status,
          like Anhui, attract large proportions of population inflow.
